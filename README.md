# 64-tap-16-bit-Finite-Impulse-Response-Filter
This project presents the design and implementation of a 64-tap, 16-bit Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter using Verilog. The design integrates a dual-clock FIFO, coefficient memory, an arithmetic logic unit, and registers to ensure efficient data flow and processing.
